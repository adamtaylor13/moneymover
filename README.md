Why yes, this is a cheap DALL-E generated icon. ðŸ˜¬

## What does it do?

MoneyMover is a Chrome extension that enhances the functionality of Lunch Money, a personal finance and budgeting tool.
The goal of MoneyMover is to make small QoL enhancements to the site.

Currently it only adds a few key-bindings:

- "n": Go to the "Next" month
- "p": Go to the "Previous" month
- "r": Click "Review Transactions" button
- "t": Go to "this" month
- "/": Focus and select the "Quick Filter" input
- "Escape": Overloaded
  - Clears applied filters (if any). It determines this on the presence of the "X Clear Filter" icon in any table.
  - Closes a modal (if open). It determines this based on a modal being open with a "close" or "cancel" button.
- "Tab": Jumps between subnav menus (Hint: Use "+ Shift" to go backwards)

At this point, all the keybindings are loosely based on Google Calendar's navigation keys.
These keys should only trigger if the user is not focused on an input element.

Future ideas:

- Close modals with "Esc"
- Save modals with "S"
- More vim-like navigation
- User options to enable/disable/remap as they like.
- Chrome Extension Store? (maybe)
